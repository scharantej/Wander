 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a travel planner application. The application should allow users to create a list of destinations they want to visit, and then plan a route between those destinations. The application should also provide information about each destination, such as the weather, attractions, and cost of living.

## Design

The application will be built using the Flask framework. The following HTML files will be needed:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application. This page will allow users to create a list of destinations they want to visit.
* `destination.html`: This page will display information about a specific destination.
* `route.html`: This page will display a map of the route between the user's destinations.

The following routes will be needed:

* `/`: The home page of the application.
* `/destination/<destination_id>`: This route will display information about a specific destination.
* `/route`: This route will display a map of the route between the user's destinations.

## Implementation

The following code shows the implementation of the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

destinations = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', destinations=destinations)

@app.route('/destination/<destination_id>')
def destination(destination_id):
    destination = destinations[int(destination_id)]
    return render_template('destination.html', destination=destination)

@app.route('/route')
def route():
    return render_template('route.html', destinations=destinations)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The application can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application can then be accessed by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
